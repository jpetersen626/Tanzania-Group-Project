### Problem Statement

For our group project we will be focusing on pumps and water points in Tanzania, their functionality, and different metrics that can inform the urgency of their repair. Using a Water Point Mapping System dataset, we will create a predictive model for well functionality in Tanzania. We have also obtained a collection of datasets from the World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal, The WHO UNICEF JMP Global Database, and the Tanzania Socio-Economic Database in order to produce a greater analysis on the infrastructural and climatological landscape of Tanzania by region. This analysis coupled with our predictive model will serve to inform next steps for prioritizing investment in some wells over others in order to save lives by bringing about the greatest improvements in utility standards across Tanzania.
